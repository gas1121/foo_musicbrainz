Check the [releases](https://github.com/19379/foo_musicbrainz/releases) page for the latest version.

My changes:

```
Fix bug where "Reset page" button in the "Preferences" didn't work on all fields.

Preferences has a new "Custom server" option.

Add country to date column.

Repository has been updated with all pre-requisites meaning it should compile as-is
with Visual Studio 2015.

Remove deprecated metadb lock/unlock methods and use get_info_ref() from the
current SDK (2015-08-03). Now requires foobar2000 v1.3 or above.
```
