Changes in this fork:

##0.3.3
```
Preferences has a new "Custom server" option.

Repository has been updated with all pre-requisites meaning it should compile as-is
with Visual Studio 2015.
```

##0.3.2
```
Add country to date column.

Remove deprecated metadb lock/unlock methods and use get_info_ref() from the
current SDK (2015-08-03). Now requires foobar2000 v1.3 or above.

Updated for Visual Studio 2015. I tried building to support Windows XP but failed
therefore Windows Vista or later is required.
```
